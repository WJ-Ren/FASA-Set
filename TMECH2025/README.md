# Getting Started

## Description

This repository contains the simulation files discussed in the paper. The `sim/` directory holds all the necessary Simulink models and scripts.

## Instructions

1. Run `setup.m` to perform the simulations.
2. Run `plot_results.m` to generate the figures presented in the paper.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB R2023a** or newer is required to run the simulation. The Simulink model is not backward-compatible with older versions.

## Data

The experimental data will be made available in this repository soon.
